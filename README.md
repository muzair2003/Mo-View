## 🚀 Features  
- **Edge Detection Algorithms**:
  - **Canny Edge Detection**: Uses adaptive thresholding to detect sharp changes in intensity.
  - **Laplacian Edge Detection**: Employs second-order derivatives to highlight regions of rapid intensity change.
  - **Sobel Edge Detection**: Detects edges based on gradients in the x and y directions.
  - **Prewitt Edge Detection**: A simpler gradient-based method using predefined kernels.  
- **Real-Time Processing**:  
  Process live camera feeds with precision.  
- **Image Filters**:  
  - Grayscale conversion  
  - Adjust contrast and brightness  
  - Other custom filters to enhance image quality
